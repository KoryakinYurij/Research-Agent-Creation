# Agentic Design Toolkit

**Governance, Architecture, and Patterns for Scalable AI Agents.**

This repository serves as a **Meta-Framework** for building robust, maintainable, and SOTA-aligned Agentic Systems. It is designed for the "Engineering Phase" of AI (2025+), moving beyond prompt engineering to **architectural guarantees**.

## Core Philosophy
**Architecture > Autonomy.**
Autonomous agents without strict architecture degrade into unreliable chat bots. This toolkit enforces a "Contract-First" approach to ensure agents are composable, auditable, and drift-resistant.

## Key Components

### 1. [The Operational Contract (`Agents.md`)](./Agents.md)
The constitution of this ecosystem. Every agent must adhere to this strict behavioral contract.
- **Mandatory 5-Step Loop**: Perception, Planning, Action, Reflection, Stop.
- **Drift Prevention**: Strict rules against mission creep.
- **Meta-Agent Auditing**: Agents are reviewed by other agents.

### 2. [Architecture & Philosophy (`Architecture.md`)](./Architecture.md)
The "Why" behind the design.
- Specialization over Generalization.
- Reflection before Evolution.
- Meta-Agents as System Guardians.

### 3. [Agent Template (`TEMPLATE_AGENT.md`)](./TEMPLATE_AGENT.md)
A copy-pasteable scaffold to create new agents that are immediately compliant with the Operational Contract.

### 4. Mandatory Reference
This toolkit is grounded in the methodologies defined in:
**`Agentic_Design_Patterns.pdf`** (based on the work by Antonio Gulli).
*Concepts covered: Reflection, Planning, Multi-Agent Consensus, Model Context Protocol (MCP), Guardrails.*

## Getting Started

1.  **Read `Agents.md`**: Understand the rules. Ignorance of the contract renders an agent invalid.
2.  **Copy `TEMPLATE_AGENT.md`**: Start your new agent file.
3.  **Map your Patterns**: explicitly map your agent's behavior to the Design Patterns.
4.  **Run Meta-Audit**: Use a Meta-Agent to audit your definition against the contract.
